My name is Joshua Crisafi, and I love to code. This is where I will publish my personal programming projects whenever I have time to work on and finish them. Please feel free to reach out to me at joshuacrisafi@gmail.com to let me know what you think. As of now, the only project posted here is my Chopsticks AI, but if you're reading this well after I've posted it then there will almost certainly be more.
